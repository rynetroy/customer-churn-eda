Ongoing exploratory data analysis of a bank customer churn dataset, examining customer behaviour and churn-related patterns.

# Exploring Customer Behaviour: An Exploratory Data Analysis of Customer Churn

##  Project Overview
This project is an ongoing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a bank customer churn dataset conducted throughout the academic term. The objective is to progressively explore customer behaviour, uncover churn-related patterns, and build a strong analytical foundation for future analysis.

---

##  Project Status
**Status:** In Progress  
This repository will be updated regularly as new analyses, visualizations, and insights are developed throughout the term.

---

##  Objectives
- Explore customer demographic and account-related features
- Identify patterns and trends associated with customer churn
- Visualize relationships between key variables
- Develop analytical insights incrementally as the project evolves

---

##  Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level information from a banking context, including:
- Demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Account attributes (e.g., balance, tenure, number of products)
- Activity indicators
- Churn indicator (used for exploratory analysis only)

---

##  Analysis Performed (So Far)
- Initial data cleaning and validation
- Summary statistics and univariate analysis
- Early churn vs. non-churn comparisons
- Preliminary visualizations

Additional analysis will be added as the project progresses.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Repository Structure


---

##  Preliminary Observations
- Early patterns suggest certain customer attributes are more strongly associated with churn
- Behavioural features appear promising for deeper analysis
- Further exploration is needed to validate and refine these insights

---

##  Notes
- This project currently focuses on **exploratory data analysis**
- No predictive modelling has been performed at this stage
- Findings may evolve as additional analysis is completed
